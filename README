I have implemented auto code completing with c/c++ by libclang, which such as assist plugin of visual studio.
But it requires vim compiled with +clientserver. Unfortunately this feature needs X server, so vim-nox does not support auto code completing.
And updating vim to 7.3.196 or later is strongly recommended. Because patch196 for vim7.3 implement InsertCharPre autocmd.
Run ':h VimLite-CodeCompletion-VIMCCC' for help about VIMCCC.

I just make a patch for vim 7.3 to add a 'noexpand' argument for 'completeopt' option which can work perfect with auto code completing.
Just downloads it in http://code.google.com/p/vimlite/downloads/list.

NOTE1: Currently, VimLite is not stable enough.
NOTE2: Currently, VimLite need Vim 7.3 or later.

Please report bugs here http://code.google.com/p/vimlite/issues/list.

After installation, run ':h VimLite.txt' for help.
