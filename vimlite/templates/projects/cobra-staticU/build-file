# build-file
# Cobra Build file for a cobra multifile build from within codelite.
# (In this case an executable (.Net exe) build
#
# Place filenames for the library to be built in this file,
# one entry per line, whitespace and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
#
# Lacking a -out:FILENAME override on the compile line
# The first filename given will have its name used as the name of the executable
# e.g
# MyApp.cobra
# appStuff.cobra
#   will generate an executable named MyApp (MyApp.exe).
