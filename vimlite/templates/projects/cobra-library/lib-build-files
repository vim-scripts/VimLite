# lib-build-files
# Cobra Build file for a cobra multifile build from within codelite.
# (In this case a Library (.Net assembly) build
#
# Place filenames for the library to be built in this file,
# one entry per line, whitespace and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
#
# Lacking a -out:FILENAME override on the compile line
# The first filename given will have its name used as the name of the library
# e.g
# Lib1.cobra
# OtherLib2.cobra
#   will generate a libraryname of Lib1.dll
